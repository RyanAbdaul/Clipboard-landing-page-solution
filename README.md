### Useful resources
- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This helped me not direcetly but it helped me lowkey to normalize the design before I start and it's always something I use in the majority of any design I make.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/?__cf_chl_tk=mJ0esK1bL4Ddl_Te4pMHeMnmcLN5pqU4hHe4st2F6nY-1707120964-0-gaNycGzNFxA) - Font Awesome library helped me adding a so good quality of icons, like the ones I use in the footer and other designs, I always use this library in most of my designs and highly recommend anyone wants good icon to download it on their websites.
